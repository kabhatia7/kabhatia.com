Hi everyone, my name is Karan Bhatia and I am a Business Quantitative Analysis student at Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo. I am starting this blog to keep myself stimulated and write about the things I like. Feel free to learn more about me on the "About" tab of this website, and if you're interested in my professional experience or any projects I have completed check out the "Resume" and "Projects" tabs. 

I am planning on writing two posts each week. One of those two posts will always be a "Song of the Week". This will usually just be me recommending a new song that I either discovered that week or an old favorite that I started listening to again. 

The other post will be any piece of content that I can come up with for the week, it could be a review for a new video game, my thoughts on a product or service, or a data analysis project that I want to share, the opportunities are endless, and I am looking forward to sharing all of it with anyone who wants to check it out. 

Thank you to everyone reading this, and I am ecstatic to have an outlet to share my thoughts on a platform that is truly my own.
